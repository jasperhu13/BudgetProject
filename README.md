This is a summary of our Budget Project. There are three main parts, SQL, WEB, and Python.

SQL:
Create a database that stores budgeting information. Columns should include Name, Price, Date, and Description.


Python:
Use SQL information and analyze the data.
Possible features could include
-- Recommended daily spending
-- Total spent per month/year/in all
-- How much you should spend to save up for a certain purchase
-- amount spent on certain types of items(Boba, food, etc)
-- Other?

Web:
We could do html or css or w/e idk. Github pages looks interesting? Not too sure how it works though.
